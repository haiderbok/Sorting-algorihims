# Sorting-algorihims
Data Structures Project 3

In this Project I implemented different sorting algorithim which included Merge sort, Quick sort, Selection Sort. 
In the second part we we modified Selection, Heap sort and Merge sort so that they become Locality aware sorting where 
I made use of the information that each element is d places away from its original location we sort the elements accordingly.

Concepts involved:

1. Array manipulation
2. Sorting 
3. Indexing
